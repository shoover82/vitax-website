  <h2>About VitaX</h2>
  <p>VitaX is a data-driven initiative that blends personalized health tracking, blockchain incentives, and community engagement. Our platform calculates a Humanity Impact Score (HIS) for each participant by integrating data from wearable devices, telehealth visits, mental health surveys and community involvement. The higher your score, the more Humanity Impact Return (HIR) tokens you earn – turning healthy habits into tangible economic and social benefits.</p>
