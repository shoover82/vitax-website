        <p>
            VitaX is a data-driven initiative that blends personalized health tracking, blockchain incentives and
            community engagement to promote well‑being and resilience. We believe that everyone deserves access
            to the tools and support they need to live healthier lives. By integrating biometric data from
            wearables and lab results with decentralized technology, we empower individuals and communities to
            own their health data, make informed decisions and earn rewards for positive actions.

                <h3>Personalized Health Scoring</h3>
                <p>
                    We combine daily metrics from devices like the Oura ring and Hume’s emotion AI with lab
                    results and mental health questionnaires to generate a holistic Health Impact Rating (HIR).
                    This score helps you understand your overall well‑being and track progress over time.

                <p>
                    Your health data belongs to you. VitaX uses decentralized technology, strong encryption and
                    best practices from HIPAA to ensure privacy, consent and secure storage. You decide who can
                    access your information.

    <section id="integrations">
        <h2>Integrations & Technology</h2>
        <p>
            VitaX integrates seamlessly with the Oura API to collect sleep, readiness and activity data, and
            with Hume’s AI to analyse emotional tone and mental health signals. Our open API allows developers
            to build applications that respect user consent and privacy while contributing to a richer health
            ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
            We employ blockchain and encryption technologies to maintain data integrity and transparency. Your
            Health Impact Rating lives on a secure ledger, and all personally identifiable information is
            encrypted both in transit and at rest.

    <section id="pilot">
        <h2>Pilot Community</h2>
        <p>
            Our first VitaX pilot launches in Union County, Florida. We are building a self‑sustaining community
            with affordable housing, health services and local economic opportunities. By partnering with
            Lake Butler Hospital and local clinics, we will test how a token economy can improve access to care,
            reduce stress and build stronger connections among neighbors.
